* play it now! https://raould.github.io/pn0gstr0m/
* "it's pong Jim, but not as we know it, Captain." (Klingons on the starboard bow!)

* gpl2 license.
* don't come here looking for exemplary code!
* this is a Desafortunados Games production.
* fyi when messing with the code it can be useful to change main.js gDebug = true, then use keys: 'a' to add pucks, 'b' to spawn next powerup, 'q' to quit the game, et. al.
* the music (so-called): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxMqvaNKx1cL2yila-UPujI08eNQrDGd9
