TODO:
* animate the menu.
* my other metal band name really is The Wrong Abstractions.
* this has quickly become an empirical big ball of mud. :-(
* all the todo's noted in code comments.
* deperately need to refactor so many globals away (re: events, below).
* what the heck is the difference of Step() vs. Draw() vs. Process*().
  * especially since they seem different for buttons vs. *States.
* also nice how Process*Input don't all have the same signature.
* (aside: debugging dx is just industrially wide horrible if you ask me.)
* confusing how i have activate key & gamepad, but esc key vs. option gamepad button.
* needing clearFn() for events hints i should push the keys through eventqueue only, never globals.
* be backwards compatible with "2 keys held down at once"?
* uh, how about handling non-en-us keyboard layouts? ha ha :-(.
* perf is worse in firefox vs. chrome/edge?
* actually profiled, but it just says "gc" so who knows what as root cause... need placement-new object pooling?
* handle device pixel ratio.
* orientation hell, including effing manifest.json?
  * support rotation resizing w/out destroying game in progress.
* wish i could hide the mouse cursor when not in use.
* move A,B,SwapBuffers into reusableArray.
* play blip if puck collides and doesn't split? too noisy?
* the ForSide()/P1/P2 thing has gotten ever more ugly & confusing.
* i feel like isUrgent isn't weighted high enough by ai cf. engorge.
* maybe add english based on paddle y velocity.
* super fugly inconsistencies, some but not all of them include:
  * should extract all the left vs. right stuff into a Side class, parent of Paddle etc.
  * sorry the "class" coding style is so randomly ugly.
  * things probably should always get 1 last draw call when lifespan is zero?
* compatibility / browser bugs:
  * check the "bug:" comments, safari is killing me?!@#
  * safari ios/ipados alpha bug on MakeRadarAnimation.
  * safari crt outline clipping not working, see the touch target!?
  * msft edge 92.0.902.67 was crashing saying gCx.roundRect doesn't exist!?
    * suddenly the machine's edge updated itself to 125.0.2535.92 fixing it.
    * are there easy to use polyfills for "new" canvas calls!?!@#?@!?!?!
* bounties (spiritual, not cash):
  * see misc bounty comments in code.
  * ie. actually implementing levels.
  * power meter that goes up/down on hit/missed pucks, for some kind of bonus.
    * power meter also goes up with things like decimate powerup.
  * if ai has no line of sight through barrier, ignore pucks on that row.
  * fix the crt outline drawing order to not leave those little corner gaps.
  * a pause menu command to swap sides (proably only in single player mode).

----------------------------------------

i frankly kinda hate javascript at times like these, perf is entirely too unclear and arbitrary across all js engines:

* at lest in v8 apparently don't use delete on {}'s, set the value to undefined or false, because performance.
  * is deleting required to avoid memory leaking? i feel like logically it should be.
* is {...nocmds} better than {} and setting entries to true/false? no idea, no way to know.

----------------------------------------

in progress:

* do i need clearFn() for gamepad buttons and joystick? or what else instead?
* check that the gamepad buttons & sticks non/repeat is sane/right.
* really test all the possible inputs!
