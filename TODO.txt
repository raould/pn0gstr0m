* all the todo:s.
* deperately need to refactor so many globals away.
* globals horrible also because of no good input/event model.
* perf is worse in firefox vs. chrome/edge.
* actually profile but it just says "gc" so who knows what as root cause... need placement-new object pooling?
* test gamepads.
* handle device pixel ratio.
* orientation hell, including effing manifest.json?
* wish i could hide the mouse cursor.
* add wavy scalines?
* move A,B,SwapBuffers into reusableArray.
* play blip if puck collides and doesn't split.
* powerup pill timeout after say 10 seconds.
* the ForSide() thing has gotten ever more ugly & confusing.
* super fugly inconsistencies:
  * should extract all the left vs. right stuff into a Side class, parent of Paddle etc.
  * clashing styles of events queue vs. immediate changes.
  * gDebug stuff is sort of super hacky all over the place.
  * sorry the "class" coding style is so randomly ugly.
  * things probably should always get 1 last draw call when lifespan is zero.
* more bugs:
  * support rotation resizing w/out destroying game in progress.
  * radar effect not showing up on my iphone?
* bounties:
  * see misc bounty comments in code.
  * power meter that goes up/down on hit/missed pucks, for some kind of bonus.
    * power meter also goes up with things like decimate powerup.
  * ai no line of sight through barrier == ignore pucks on that row.
