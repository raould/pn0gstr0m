* all the todo's noted in code comments.
* this has quickly become an empirical big ball of mud. :-(
* warning: things in code tend to not be simply what they seem / what you'd expect, even for me.
* support webgl (e.g. via pixijs) to get performance (vs. e.g. cavas color string hell).
* comment out asserts in out/* somehow, for perf.
* pill/powerup code is across too many files, i am so confused.
* cmds vs. targets vs. button polling is a buggy mess, needs to be unified.
* the general coding suck of not knowing which things must/not be done via property functions.
* the level index, game mode, single player stuff is now a nightmare.
* the level should live longer than just the GameState.
* 2 player mode should not have levels, just be zen mode.
* high score totalling across levels (esp. for zen single player).
* funny how many different ways of doing a timeout there are.
* gLevelIndex is a code smell, but is a nightmare to fix. i tried.
* the ownership graph is heck even if done right.
* figure out per-game high score ui ux.
* need to specify first puck speed specifically rather than ratio?
* better (yet safe) color for low hp on xtra and barrier?
* quit should really ask ays?
* maybe have rare 3x split into even smaller, faster pucks?
* do i need clearFn() for gamepad buttons and joystick? or what else instead?
* check that the gamepad buttons & sticks non/repeat is sane/right.
* really test all the possible inputs!
* hm, original pucks must also speed up at the end of the level?
* playtest all the speedup/timeout/english factors, sheesh.
* animate the menu opening/closing?
* my other metal band name really is The Wrong Abstractions. :-(
* clean up var t = T01(anim.lifespan0-anim.life, anim.lifespan0);
* deperately need to refactor so many globals away (re: events, below).
* what the heck is the difference of Step() vs. Draw() vs. Process*().
  * especially since they seem different for buttons vs. *States. :-(
* also nice how Process*Input don't all have the same signature.
* (aside: debugging dx is just horrible industrially-wide if you ask me.)
* confusing how i have activate key & gamepad, but esc key vs. option gamepad button.
* needing clearFn() for events hints i should push the keys through eventqueue only, never globals.
* (esc) shouldn't disappear after staring via touch.
* cannot tap (esc) if the rhs pointer is already down? also check how it works in 1 vs. 2 player.
* be backwards compatible with "2 keys held down at once"?
* ClearPointer() when clicking outside open menu to close it feels ugly.
* uh, how about handling non-en-us keyboard layouts? ha ha :-(.
* perf is worse in firefox vs. chrome/edge?
* actually profiled, but it just says "gc" so who knows what as root cause... need placement-new object pooling?
* handle device pixel ratio.
* orientation hell, including effing manifest.json?
  * support rotation resizing w/out destroying game in progress.
* wish i could hide the mouse cursor when not in use.
* move A,B,SwapBuffers into reusableArray.
* play blip if puck collides and doesn't split? too noisy?
* the ForSide()/P1/P2 thing has gotten ever more ugly & confusing.
* i feel like isUrgent isn't weighted high enough by ai cf. engorge.
* maybe add english based on paddle y velocity.
* i know "!!" et. al. are dangerous but i can't stop using them sometimes.
* very bad code smell wrt maxVX and order of how it gets set and used.
  * also uh no idea how/why/where puck.vx gets to be > than {gameState,level}.maxVX
* super fugly inconsistencies, some but not all of them include:
  * should extract all the left vs. right stuff into a Side class, parent of Paddle etc.
  * sorry the "class" coding style is so randomly ugly.
  * things probably should always get 1 last draw call when lifespan is zero?
* compatibility / browser bugs:
  * check the "bug:" comments, safari is killing me?!@#
  * safari ios/ipados alpha bug on MakeRadarAnimation.
  * safari crt outline clipping not working, see the touch target!?
  * msft edge 92.0.902.67 was crashing saying gCx.roundRect doesn't exist!?
    * suddenly the machine's edge updated itself to 125.0.2535.92 fixing it.
    * are there easy to use polyfills for "new" canvas calls!?!@#?@!?!?!
* bounties (spiritual, not cash):
  * see misc bounty comments in code.
  * ie. actually implementing levels.
  * power meter that goes up/down on hit/missed pucks, for some kind of bonus.
    * power meter also goes up with things like decimate powerup.
  * if ai has no line of sight through barrier, ignore pucks on that row.
  * fix the crt outline drawing order to not leave those little corner gaps.
  * a pause menu command to swap sides (proably only in single player mode).

----------------------------------------

i frankly kinda hate javascript at times like these, perf is entirely too unclear and arbitrary across all js engines:

* at lest in v8 apparently don't use delete on {}'s, set the value to undefined or false, because performance.
  * is deleting required to avoid memory leaking? i feel like logically it should be.
* is {...nocmds} better than {} and setting entries to true/false? no idea, no way to know.

----------------------------------------

zen mode hell:
* local storage for menu.
* high score is different.
* ugh even more of lots of conditionals now.
